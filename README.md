## Features

### 01 · Active Layer Scanner

Connects to any Dataverse environment via the OData v9.2 REST API, queries all customizable component types, and identifies anything sitting in the active (unmanaged) layer on top of managed solutions.

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Active Layer** | Unmanaged change on top of a managed component — export risk |
| **Unmanaged** | Component has never been part of any managed solution |
| **Base Layer** | Clean — fully managed |

Results are searchable, filterable by status, exportable to CSV, and saved to local history.

---

### 02 · Option Set Guard

Three tools in one page for protecting option set values that deployment pipelines routinely overwrite.

**Option Set Guard** — compares live environment values against a pinned client config and restores any drift with one click.

**Document vs Dev** — paste a table from Microsoft Loop, Excel, or Google Sheets and compare against the live environment. The parser handles blank lines, reversed columns, CRLF endings, and prefers global option sets over local when both are present. Includes 16 unit tests.

**Environment Comparison** — diff option set values between any two environments side by side.

---

### 03 · Deployment Readiness Checker

Runs 6 checks in parallel via `Promise.all` against a Dataverse environment and returns a single pass/warn/fail report.

| Check | What it validates |
|---|---|
| Active Layer | No unmanaged customizations on managed components |
| Cloud Flows | All required flows are enabled |
| Solutions | Consistent versions, no duplicate managed layers |
| Environment Variables | All vars have values or defaults |
| Connection References | All refs are connected and healthy |
| Option Sets | Protected values match the pinned client config |

Also includes a **dry-run fix preview** — identifies what can be auto-remediated (disabled flows, missing env var defaults, broken connection refs) and returns a plan for human review before any changes are made.

---

### 04 · Environment Comparison

Diffs two Dataverse environments in parallel across four dimensions: solutions, environment variables, connection references, and cloud flows. Each section is collapsible with a count badge and a detailed diff table.

---

### 05 · Cloud Flow Monitor

**Flow Health** — every flow's status, last run time, trigger type, and connection ref dependencies.

**Silent Trigger Detection** — flags enabled flows that have never fired or haven't triggered in 7+ days. Surfaces flows that look healthy in the Power Apps UI but are silently doing nothing.

**Out of Sync** — compares flow states between two environments to surface configuration drift.

**Connection Reference Health Map** — every connection ref, its live credential status, which flows depend on it, and the blast radius if it breaks. Includes a visual dependency graph.

**Auto-fix** — locates a healthy donor connection ref of the same connector type and copies its credential to the broken one. Requires explicit confirmation before executing.

---

### 06 · Pipeline Health Dashboard

**Overview stats** — total runs, success rate, active pipelines, average duration across a configurable time window.

**Per-pipeline sparklines** — inline SVG charts of the last 10 run outcomes, rendered client-side with no charting library.

**Flaky detection** — identifies pipelines that alternate pass/fail on the same codebase, indicating agent or environment instability rather than code issues.

**Run detail drawer** — fetches the build timeline and logs for a failed run, matches against 22 error patterns, and surfaces the identified error with a plain-English suggested fix.

Error patterns covered: npm (peer deps, network, missing scripts) · TypeScript · .NET/MSBuild · missing SDK · auth failures · permissions · ECONNREFUSED · timeouts · DNS · disk full · Docker daemon · image not found · test failures · job timeout · file not found · permission denied · command not found · Azure resource not found · non-zero exit codes

**Cancel and Retry** — cancel a running build or re-queue a failed one directly from the drawer.

---

### 07 · Pipeline Optimizer

Analyzes Azure DevOps YAML pipelines against 47 performance rules, applies safe fixes in-place, and opens a draft PR. `refs/heads/main` is never touched.

**Single Pipeline mode** — select a definition → analyze → view findings with per-rule time estimates → apply → draft PR opened on `vantage/optimize-{name}`.

**Entire Repository mode** — scans every YAML pipeline concurrently (limit 3 parallel workers), crawls all referenced template files across repositories (up to 50 files per pipeline, recursive), deduplicates shared template files so each is only modified once, and creates one draft PR per repository containing all changes in a single commit.

**47 rules across 5 optimization areas:**

| Area | Example rules |
|---|---|
| Checkout | Shallow/partial clone, disable tags and LFS, sparse checkout review |
| Power Platform | Async import/export, skip unchanged solutions, stable hash |
| Build and artifacts | Selective downloads, modern artifact tasks, avoid duplicate restore/build |
| Caching and execution | npm, NuGet, pip, Maven, PowerShell modules, CI batching and path filters |
| Parallelism | Parallel environment stages, build/test concurrency, test sharding |

Savings are calculated per finding. The largest gains come from eliminating unnecessary runs and work, then parallelizing the remaining independent stages.

Branch safety: verifies target branch exists, checks optimizer branch doesn't already exist, creates branch and commit in separate API calls, all PRs are drafts, requires explicit `safetyAcknowledged` flag in the request body.

## Security

| Layer | Implementation |
|---|---|
| HTTP security headers | `helmet` — CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options |
| CORS | Only `localhost:*` origins accepted (or explicit `FRONTEND_URL`) |
| API key auth | Every `/api/*` request requires a valid `X-API-Key` header |
| Rate limiting | 200 requests / 15 min / IP via `express-rate-limit` |
| Payload size | 100 kb max via `express.json({ limit })` |
| OAuth2 token acquisition | MSAL `ConfidentialClientApplication` — tokens stay server-side |
| SSRF prevention | Environment URLs validated against HTTPS + `.dynamics.com` allowlist |
| Path traversal | Optimizer file paths checked for `..`, bare `/`, and newline characters |
| Credential storage | Written to `data/config.json`, never logged or returned to the client |
| Setup endpoint | `/setup/*` routes are unauthenticated by design — only functional before credentials exist |

## For developers

**Dev mode with hot reload:**
```bash
# Terminal 1 — backend
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 — frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
Backend: http://localhost:3001 · Frontend: http://localhost:5173

The setup wizard works in dev mode and writes to `data/config.json`. You can also create `backend/.env` from `backend/.env.example` to skip the wizard.

**Build the standalone exe:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build          # output: frontend/dist/

cd ../backend
npm run build          # output: backend/dist/
npm run package        # output: vantage.exe
# copy frontend/dist → public/ next to vantage.exe before running
```

**Docker:**
```bash
docker compose up --build          # serves everything on http://localhost:3001
```

**Publish a release** — GitHub Actions builds the exe and publishes automatically:
```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```
